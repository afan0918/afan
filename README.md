## Use software to simplify the process of doing machine learning.

The project is fork from [Use-Logistic-regression-to-process-data](https://github.com/afan0918/Use-Logistic-regression-to-process-data)(in my repositories).

### This topic addresses the minimum jdk requirements to run Afan, jdk 15.

## Explanation of hyperparameters

### Logistic Regression

#### Algorithm : L-BFGS

*    MaxIter

maximum number of iterations

*    lambda(λ)

Tune the overall impact of the regularization term by multiplying its value.

Encourages weight values toward 0 (but not exactly 0)

Encourages the mean of the weights toward 0, with a normal (bell-shaped or Gaussian) distribution.

*    tolerance

To stop searching for a minimum (or maximum) 

once some tolerance is achieved, i.e. once you're close enough.

#### The result of each execution will be the same, not random.

### SVM(Support Vector Machine)

#### Algorithm : LASVM

*    c->cost

The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example. 

For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. 

Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points. 

For very tiny values of C, you should get misclassified examples, often even if your training data is linearly separable.

*    tolerance

To stop searching for a minimum (or maximum) 

once some tolerance is achieved, i.e. once you're close enough.

#### Each execution result will be different
